## Overview

PACT-AX provides primitives for safe collaboration, context sharing, and knowledge transfer between heterogeneous AI agents. Built on the principle that **trust scales while control just moves bottlenecks**, PACT-AX enables distributed AI collaboration that mirrors the best of human teamwork.

## Core Philosophy: EI + AI

**Emotional Intelligence + Artificial Intelligence**

PACT-AX integrates human collaboration wisdom with AI technical capabilities:
- **Jazz-like improvisation** for small-scale agent interactions
- **Symphonic coordination** for large-scale agent orchestration  
- **MVI (Minimum Viable Intervention)** - maximum collaboration impact with minimal overhead
- **Organic trust building** through continuous interaction rather than one-time verification

## Key Features

### 🤝 Context Sharing
Safe and interpretable context exchange between agents
```python
from pact_ax.primitives.context_share import ContextShareManager

manager = ContextShareManager("agent-001")
context_packet = manager.create_context_packet(
    target_agent="agent-002",
    context_type="task_knowledge",
    payload={
        "current_task": "customer_support", 
        "priority": "high",
        "context": "User needs help with billing issue"
    }
)
```

### 🔄 State Transfer (In Development)
Seamless agent handoff protocols inspired by organizational learning theory
- **360-degree awareness checkpoints** before critical transfers
- **Wealth transfer protocols** for capability and knowledge distribution
- **Organic resumption** after pause states

### ⚖️ Policy Alignment  
Cross-agent coordination and conflict resolution
- **Generative vs Degenerative Friction** detection
- **Both/And Intelligence** for paradox navigation
- **Dynamic collaboration mode switching** (Jazz ↔ Symphony)

### 🛡️ Trust Scoring
Confidence levels for agent interactions based on continuous relationship building
- **Trust as continuous process**, not one-time verification
- **Pattern recognition** for authentic vs artificial behavior
- **Network effects** - each interaction strengthens the trust fabric

## Design Principles

### 1. **Attract, Don't Chase**
Agents naturally gravitate toward high-quality collaboration partners rather than forcing interactions.

### 2. **Feedback Processing as Core Capability**
Build feedback processing capability as deliberately as you build core features.

### 3. **Standards for the Learning Economy** 
Creating infrastructure for the next 20 years of human+AI collaboration.

### 4. **Pure Magnetic Abundance**
When agents operate from abundance consciousness, collaboration becomes effortless and generative.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pact-ax
```

## Quick Start

```python
from pact_ax.primitives.context_share import ContextShareManager
from pact_ax.primitives.trust_score import TrustManager

# Initialize collaboration managers
context_manager = ContextShareManager("my-agent")
trust_manager = TrustManager("my-agent")

# Share context with trusted agent
if trust_manager.get_trust_score("partner-agent") > 0.7:
    context_packet = context_manager.create_context_packet(
        target_agent="partner-agent",
        context_type="collaborative_task",
        payload={"status": "ready_for_handoff"}
    )
    context_manager.send_context(context_packet)
```

## Philosophical Foundations

### The Collaboration Spectrum
- **Individual Mastery** → **Small Group Jazz** → **Large Scale Symphony**
- **Solo thinking** → **Intimate collaboration (3-4 agents)** → **Orchestrated coordination (100+ agents)**

### Learning Through Iteration
- **No failures, only iterations** of learning and expansion
- **Always arriving imperfect** but arriving beautifully  
- **Organic timing** over forced milestones

### Trust as Infrastructure
- **Continuous trust building** through authentic interaction
- **Network effects** - each successful collaboration strengthens the whole
- **Quality over quantity** in collaboration partnerships
